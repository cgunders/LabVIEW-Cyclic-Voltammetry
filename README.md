# LabVIEW-Cyclic-Voltammetry
Cyclic Voltammetry program written in LabVIEW 2016 for indefinite recording

This program is for the indefinite recording of voltage and current during a two electrode cyclic voltammetry experiment. The analog inputs of the National Instruments card are connected to the voltage monitor and filtered current output of a Dagan Chem-Clamp voltammeter. Gain and filtering are controlled through the Chem-Clamp. The voltage on the electrodes is controlled by the Chem-Clamp and is externally controlled by a EG&G PARC Model 175 Universal Programmer. Any waveform generator can be used. 

Enclosed is the LabVIEW file written in LabVIEW 2016 64-bit along with Mathscript 2016 and NI DAQ 2016, both 64-bit. Also included is the VI snippet and 3 images of the front panel after recording the oxidation of 1 mM ferrocene methanol in 100 mM potassium chloride at different scan rates of 20 mV/s, 200 mV/s, and 2 V/s. The working electrode is a 12.7 um diameter gold electrode and the reference/counter electrode is a Ag/AgCl quasi-reference electrode.
